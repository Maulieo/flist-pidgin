F-Chat BBCode is supported. Icon tags work in chat rooms, but do not work in IMs.

The commands are similar in syntax to the commands on F-Chat.

/search is a new command. Users found in the search are temporarily added to your buddy list (until your next search or your next login). If you want to keep one on your buddy list, just move him out of the default group.

/ad `<message>` is the channel command to advertise for a roleplay.

/showads, /showchat, /hideads, /hidechat are the channel commands to show and hide chat and ads from you. Your settings are saved if the channel is on your buddy list.

Your F-Chat status will not be synchronized with your Pidgin status, unless you select it as an account option.

Some commands are also available as an account action. Go to Accounts->(Your Account) to access them.

There are account settings to download your friends list (enabled by default) and bookmarks (disabled by default).
Enabling these options automatically adds your friends and bookmarks, respectively, to your Pidgin buddy list.
Note that on the F-List website, bookmarks are tied to your account, whereas friends are tied to your character.

To add/remove friends and bookmarks, go to your buddy list and right click the buddy.
**Friends and bookmarks are never added or removed automatically, even when you add/remove someone to/from your buddy list.**

If you receive the error message "Identification failed.", it means that you got a ticket (your account name and password are correct), but the server refused to accept it, which means that either your character name is incorrect or something unknown went wrong.

The Hash method is no longer supported.
